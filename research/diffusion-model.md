# Diffusion Model: past, present and future

Generative modeling in diffusion model is based on ***score-based modeling*** instead of other two popular modeling approaches **i)** likelihood modeling, e.g. autoregressive **ii)** implicit model, e.g. Generative Adversarial Network.

This (new)* direction astonishes me due to the following paper:

- [Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/file/49ad23d1ec9fa4bd8d77d02681df5cfa-Paper.pdf), `nips2021`

> * might not be new, since every new trends in deep learning might be studied long ago without current great computation power.
